Extend hard rain lyrics!  Mediocre compared to the real thing, but some flashes
of ... something.

To use:

```
# make sure you have bash, python3, npm before even trying.
bash ./setup.sh
# in one terminal, start a server for doing completions.
bash ./serve.sh
# in another terminal, ask for completions for a prompt.
# be patient!  the program will spit out many completions, flagging a few
# that meet a minimal syllable-count test.
bash ./extend.sh I met
bash ./extend.sh I saw
...
```

Result
=======

(Part Dylan, part network - can you tell which is which?) (of course you can) (I picked prompts for extend.sh, then pasted in the lines it flagged as good).

Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
I've driven six hundred miles from Salem to Doordarsh
I've walked the normal routes and stopped all my work
I've watched jagged peaks rise out of thin air
I've taken what the chief officer put there
I've been part of a magnificent stream of sunlight
I've slid past a giant doll who stole my boots
I've been hit and I've been beaten and I've been blinded
I've got a house a day from a dead elder
I've been underneath the kiss of death from predators
I've walked in front of an enormous bell
I've been trying to watch my little princess enter
I've kept you as a customer in an entire lake
I've driven the full twelve miles of grass every month
I've stumbled onto a dead church in shining white
I've been the last thing a child's mind ever heard
I've been out behind this mountain off center
I've been painted into the ground for five days
I've been ripped apart in the flip of a whimper
I've put up a tent with missing coiled animal teeth
I've come down from there to dig a puddle of sand
I've failed many times in my quest for justice
I've been shut inside by a sweltering iron grate
I've been in front of a few simple rivers
I've been reading Ovid's Discourse 'Lamentus'
I've waited in the city's dim lighting for ten hours
I've thrown up on the back of a green blanket
I've been out in front of no water at all
I've been out in front of eight hundred red-headed snakes
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Oh, what did you see, my blue eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
I saw some unknown reptile that was hunting whales
I saw the light of day on the roar of the seal
I saw these colorful turtles and they looked human
I saw an engine rolling into town with a brake
I saw another turtle in the other direction
I saw an elaborate mental evaluation
I saw bones! They appeared to be underwater
I saw some very ugly children falling by the sand
I saw a giant dying tree blow through my horse's head
I saw the sun rise two thousand feet above my head
I saw my mother's crib as she lay in the winter sky
I saw a giant corpse thrown across the road
I saw the distant blue light of Kenderby's chain
I saw these giant lizards crawling against these rocks
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'
I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
I heard a lost voice grow on the string of pillars
I heard the wind and knew I was headed for the ocean
I heard his voice crying out on the promontory
I heard the sound of wind beating at the top of the hill
I heard an airboom while cleaning the firetrap
I heard the sound of the tramp â€” babbling of the sheep
I heard trees grow near to me as I'm on the ground
I heard someone talking about my missing wife
I heard the wind blowing hard enough to break my leg
I heard the roar of the high tide descending on me
I heard a black rattle behind me and I screamed
I heard thunder bang and I saw a man on horseback
I heard my own heartbeat rush through the forest to reach me
I heard her gasp when I passed through and it scared me
I heard bells wail when I had drawn this distance from the air
I heard the voice of a woman say 'I've seen something
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Oh, who did you meet my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred
I met it myself in one of those lonely treks
I met the chickens and had the mice and birds just go by
I met a little boy who looked just like my my left dad
I met Marjan at one o'clock every morning
I met nine crystal fireflies in a minute
I met all these things of madness and there's nothing for me
I met a grizzly bear and I stopped to pluck his scales
I met you after your ice-cream delivery
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what'll you do now my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
Where the people are a many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
Where the sun was rising before the Eunuch's death
Where the faint sweet earth grated back beneath my feet
Where the sky will be bright before the dark glides down
Where the earth stands has been my greatest dream ever
Where the hell are these roads? No one's seen this machine made
Where the hell does a five hundred pound deer find one?
Where the first thing to feel excited about is music
Where the savannah always stands would be coming
Where the hell am I and where is my head? What's behind me?
Where the power never sleeps the island never sleeps
Where the eye of ancient nightmares catches up to me
And I'll tell and think it and speak it and breathe it
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
But I'll know my songs well before I start singin'
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Here's a rewrite of another random song (Lewis Capaldi - Someone You Loved),
with the first half of every sentence kept unchanged, rhyming enforced,
absolutely no cherry-picking:

```
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
```

```
I'm going under, and this time, I'm getting it in my body
This all or nothing really got passed off as immortality
I need somebody to stick a needle in the bone
Somebody to have, somebody to let go
It's easy to say, you know why you came
I guess I kinda liked the start of the following day
```
